When extending the connection to your **VL53L0X** sensor with **10 feet of wire**, you'll need to make sure that the wire you choose can handle the relatively low signal levels of I2C communication and power delivery without introducing too much noise or signal degradation.

### Here's what to consider:

1. **Wire Gauge:**
   - For **I2C** and power connections, you don't need a very thick wire. Generally, **24-26 AWG** wire should be sufficient for such distances (10 feet or ~3 meters). Thicker wire (like 22 AWG) might be a little more difficult to work with, but it would provide lower resistance, which could be helpful in cases where voltage drop becomes a concern.
   - If you're using longer distances (over 10 feet), you may want to consider thicker wire (18 AWG or 20 AWG) for power (VCC and GND) to avoid any voltage drop.

2. **Twisted Pair for I2C:**
   - I2C is quite sensitive to noise, so **twisting the SDA and SCL wires together** is highly recommended. This reduces the effect of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and helps maintain signal integrity over longer distances.
   - For I2C communication, it’s important that the **SDA** and **SCL** wires are twisted tightly together. This minimizes cross-talk and ensures better communication reliability.

3. **Use of Pull-Up Resistors:**
   - I2C requires **pull-up resistors** on both the **SDA** and **SCL** lines. These are typically 4.7kΩ to 10kΩ resistors, depending on your setup. You may need to use slightly **stronger pull-ups** (e.g., 2.2kΩ or 3.3kΩ) if you're running the I2C over long distances, as the longer wire will cause signal degradation.
   
4. **Shielded Cable (optional but recommended for very long distances):**
   - If you're planning to run the wires in environments with significant electrical interference, you could consider using **shielded I2C cables**. The shield will help protect the data lines from external electrical noise.
   - You can use standard **shielded twisted pair (STP) cables** for I2C, but this is generally only necessary for really long runs or environments with heavy electrical interference (e.g., industrial settings).

### Summary of Required Wire and Setup:
- **Wire Gauge:** 24-26 AWG for I2C and power lines.
- **Twisted Pair:** For the **SDA** (data) and **SCL** (clock) lines to reduce noise.
- **Pull-up Resistors:** 4.7kΩ to 10kΩ on **SDA** and **SCL** (lower resistance for longer distances if necessary).
- **Optional Shielded Cable:** For environments with significant electrical noise.

### Recommended Wiring for 10 Feet:
1. **SDA and SCL**: Use **24-26 AWG twisted pair wire** for SDA and SCL.
2. **VCC and GND**: Use **24 AWG** (or thicker if needed) for power lines (VCC and GND).
3. **Pull-up Resistors**: Add **4.7kΩ** pull-up resistors between **SDA and VCC**, and **SCL and VCC** (on the Raspberry Pi or microcontroller board).

### Example:

- **For I2C communication:**
  - **SDA and SCL wires:** 24 AWG twisted pair (24-26 AWG can also be used).
  - **Pull-up resistors:** 4.7kΩ (you can try 2.2kΩ if the signal is weak over the longer distance).
  
- **For power (VCC/GND):**
  - **Power lines:** 24 AWG wire should suffice, but you can go with 22 AWG for reduced voltage drop if your setup is more power-demanding.

### Conclusion:
With these recommendations, your **VL53L0X sensor** should work properly even over a **10-foot distance**, as long as you keep the I2C communication lines twisted and minimize any interference. If you experience any communication issues, consider experimenting with slightly lower pull-up resistances or using shielded cables.
