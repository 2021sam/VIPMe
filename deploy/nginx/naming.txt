The naming convention for `User` and `Group` in a systemd service file follows Linux user and group management rules:

### **User Naming Convention:**
- Typically corresponds to an existing system user.
- Can be a standard user (e.g., `pi`, `ubuntu`) or a dedicated service user (e.g., `www-data`).
- Should not be root unless absolutely necessary for security reasons.
- Should be lowercase and avoid special characters.

### **Group Naming Convention:**
- Typically corresponds to an existing system group.
- Common web service groups: `www-data`, `nginx`, `gunicorn`.
- Should be lowercase and consistent with related services.
- Can be the same as `User` or a group that grants access to needed resources.

### **Example Conventions:**
- **For a personal app (running as `pi`):**
  ```ini
  User=pi
  Group=www-data
  ```
  - `pi`: Runs the process.
  - `www-data`: Ensures Nginx can interact with the app.

- **For a dedicated service user (more secure):**
  ```ini
  User=flaskuser
  Group=flaskgroup
  ```
  - `flaskuser`: A user dedicated to running Flask.
  - `flaskgroup`: A group managing access.
